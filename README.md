2. Open the site
   - Option A: Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - Option B (recommended for some browser features): Serve with a local HTTP server:
     - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`
     - Node (http-server): `npx http-server .` then open the provided URL

## Project structure
- index.html — main entry page
- /css — stylesheets
- /js — JavaScript files
- /assets or /images — images and media
- README.md — this file

(Adjust paths if your repo uses different names.)

## Deployment

To publish on GitHub Pages:

1. Ensure the repository has a branch with your site files (commonly `main`).
2. In repository Settings → Pages, select the branch (`main`) and root (`/`) or the `gh-pages` branch if you choose to build to that.
3. Save and wait a few minutes for the site to become available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

Alternatively, deploy to Netlify, Vercel, Surge, or any static hosting provider.

## Customization tips
- Update site metadata in `index.html` (title, description, social previews).
- Replace content in the About/Projects/Skills sections.
- Add project images to `/assets` and reference them in the Projects section.
- Use CSS variables (if available in your styles) to quickly change color themes.
